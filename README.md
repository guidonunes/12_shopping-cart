# Shopping Cart Project

## Overview

This repository serves as a learning project for practicing and documenting my progress in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using JavaScript. The goal is to build a functional shopping cart while applying key JavaScript concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and event handling.

Through this project, I'm exploring essential OOP principles and modern JavaScript techniques, tracking my learning step by step.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to:

* Learn and practice OOP concepts.
* Understand how to structure JavaScript code using classes and objects.
* Apply modern JavaScript features like the this keyword, ternary operator, and spread operator.
* Document my learning process and progress over time.

## File Structure
* index.html: Basic HTML structure for the shopping cart UI.
* index.js: The JavaScript file where all the logic resides, including class definitions and cart manipulation methods.
* styles.css: CSS file for styling the shopping cart interface.

## Key Concepts Practiced

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I learned how to define classes, create objects, and implement methods for handling shopping cart functionality.
* The this keyword: Understanding how this works within different execution contexts inside class methods.
* Ternary operator: Using the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
* Spread operator: Applying the spread operator to manage arrays and objects efficiently.

## Future Learning Goals
Implement persistent storage using localStorage to save the cart items between sessions.
Add quantity management for items in the cart.
Refactor the code for optimization and readability.

## How to Use

* To view and interact with the project:
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
  3. Add, remove, and manage items in the shopping cart to see how the logic works.
